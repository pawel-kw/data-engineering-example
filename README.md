# Data Engineering Example
Example repo of a Data Engineering pipeline

# Ideas
* Use Terraform to setup the components:
  - [Composer](https://cloud.google.com/composer) in GCP
  - [GreatExpectations](https://greatexpectations.io/gx-oss) in GCP
 * Setup local development environment with local versions of Airflow and GXP
 * [Data Engineering Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) for inspirations on what data can be used for an example pipeline
